                <p>
                    I'm a 23 year old software developer currently living in Madison, WI. I enjoy
                    doing a lot of things outside like going for long bike rides, playing basketball
                    or hiking. During the winter months however you can mostly find me indoors
                    reading, playing video games, or bingeing tv shows. "The mind is everything.

                    I create software to enhance the efficiency of clinician documentation so they

                    For my first internship in college I worked as an Application Developer intern
                    at a small consulting firm based in Pittsburgh, PA.
                    <br />
                    Most notably I was the lead intern on a project to build a schedule optimizer
                    for healthcare workers in response to Covid-19.

                    I graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelors Degree in computer science and a
                    minor in statistics.
                    <br />
                    I was able to take a multitude of classes ranging from the fields of
                    mathematics, history, psychology, philosophy and most importantly computer
                    science.
                    <br />
                    I am very thankful for my time and the wonderful friends I made along the way
                    while attending Pitt.
